//! Base class of most objects of the MyEngine.

    //! Grabs the object. Increments the reference counter by one.
    //! Someone who calls grab() to an object, should later also call
    //! drop() to it. If an object never gets as much drop() as grab()
    //! calls, it will never be destroyed.
    //! The IUnknown class provides a basic reference counting mechanism
    //! with its methods grab() and drop(). Most objects of the Irrlicht
    //! Engine are derived from IUnknown, and so they are reference counted.
    //!
    //! When you create an object in the Irrlicht engine, calling a method
    //! which starts with 'create', an object is created, and you get a pointer
    //! to the new object. If you no longer need the object, you have
    //! to call drop(). This will destroy the object, if grab() was not called
    //! in another part of you program, because this part still needs the object.
    //! Note, that you only need to call drop() to the object, if you created it,
    //! and the method had a 'create' in it.
    //!
    //! A simple example:
    //!
    //! If you want to create a texture, you may want to call an imaginable method
    //! IDriver::createTexture. You call
    //! ITexture* texture = driver->createTexture(dimension2d<s32>(128, 128));
    //! If you no longer need the texture, call texture->drop().
    //! If you want to load a texture, you may want to call imaginable method
    //! IDriver::loadTexture. You do this like
    //! ITexture* texture = driver->loadTexture("example.jpg");
    //! You will not have to drop the pointer to the loaded texture, because
    //! the name of the method does not start with 'create'. The texture
    //! is stored somewhere by the driver.
